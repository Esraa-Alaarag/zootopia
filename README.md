Embassy Passport Tracking System
-----------------------
My app is a passport tracking application for any Embassy . The embassies usually can pull the information of the people who wants to renew their passport  from their country Database then after adding the required information the can add the embassy releated information. the applicants using their Social secuirty number will be able to check the status of their application.

####part 1 : creating API

##### Section 1
pulling data from goverment database:

*  Display all records from gov api
*  Display one individually on click, inform the user if the applicant is wanted by the govenment.
*  Copy the required field to embassy databsae and inform the user if the record is already exist
* 	Search the database using social security number field
although the API is programmed to full crud funcionality, I did not want the embasy staff to delete or change the user information within the government database . because In my opioion he is suppose to do that.
